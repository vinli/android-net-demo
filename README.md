# Android Vinli Net Demo

This is a simple demo application demonstrating the usage of the [Vinli Net SDK](https://github.com/vinli/android-net). It makes heavy use of RxJava, but deep knowledge the mechanics of rx should not be required. Refer to [TechCrunchDemoActivity.java](app/src/main/java/li/vin/netdemo/NetDemoActivity.java) for comments documenting usage.
